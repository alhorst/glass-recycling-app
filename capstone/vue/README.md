# Vitrum: A Community Glass Recycling App :recycle:

## What Is It?
This project began as our final capstone at Tech Elevator, a full-stack development bootcamp based in Java. The idea came from one of our contributors, Matt Hosner, who saw a need in his local Pittsburgh community for better community glass recycling (and where he didn't have to drive 30 minutes)! This app streamlines the glass recycling process, allowing users to easily register and schedule pickups. An admin and driver login, along with Google Routes API, ensure that pickups are assigned to the most efficient routes. The app also features a point-based incentive system that rewards users for their recycling efforts, encouraging them to reduce waste and support sustainable living. Built using Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Vue.js framework.

# Vitrum: A Community Glass Recycling App

## What Is It?
This project began as our final capstone at Tech Elevator, a full-stack development bootcamp based in Java; the idea came from one of our contributors, Matt Hosner, who saw a need in his local Pittsburgh community for better glass recycling. The app has different functionality based on whether you are an administrator, driver, or a residential/business user. Administrators can create and assign routes, pickups, and add recycling point goals; drivers can view routes and pickups; and residential/business users can schedule pickups, track recycling achievements, and redeem points for prizes. The app will eventually be mobile-friendly (some parts of it are already) as drivers are primarily using it on the go!
